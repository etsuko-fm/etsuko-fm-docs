# Compatibility

<div className="content-container">

### Norns hardware

Eterna works with both factory norns (manufactured by [monome](http://monome.org/)) and [norns shield (DIY)](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/). 


### Norns firmware

The minimum recommended firmware is [version 231114](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-update-231114/64915). However, using the latest firmware is recommended. 

The most recent firmware Eterna has actively been tested with is [version 260102](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-update-260102/73835).

If you encounter problems with a particular hardware or firmware version, please report so in the [Eterna topic on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/eterna/73584).

### Mods
There's a lively ecosystem of mods for norns. Eterna works with many of them, but may also be incompatible with others. If you encounter an incompatible mod, feel free to leave a reply in the [Eterna topic on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/eterna/73584) and we'll see if there's a possible solution.
