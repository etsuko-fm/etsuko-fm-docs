# Compatibility

<div className="content-container">

Eterna is a script for [monome norns](https://monome.org/docs/norns/). It works with both factory norns (manufactured by [monome](http://monome.org/)) and [norns shield (DIY)](https://monome.org/docs/norns/shield/). 

The minimum recommended firmware is [version 231114](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-update-231114/64915), because of the 60 fps screen driver update. However, using the latest firmware is recommended. 

The most recent firmware Eterna has actively been tested with is [version 260102](https://llllllll.co/t/norns-update-260102/73835).

If you encounter problems with a particular hardware or firmware version, please report so in the [Eterna thread on lines](https://llllllll.co/t/eterna/73584).
