# Envelopes

Applies an A/D envelope of adjustable duration (E2) and variable curvature (K3) to the amplitude of the slice. A single button, shape (E3), controls how attack and decay relate to each other. The envelope times can be modulated by the sequencer's velocity using the MOD parameter (K2). When Lowpass Gate (LPG) is selected as MOD option, a lowpass filter is enabled for each voice, and the envelope controls not only amplitude, but also cutoff frequency. In this mode, the envelope time is also modulated by the sequencer's velocity.

#### Controls
- K2: Modulation (OFF/TIME/LPG)
- K3: Envelope curve (Negative / Linear / Positive)
- E2: Time - total duration of the envelope
- E3: Shape - skews envelope towards longer decay or longer attack
