A delay effect with a selectable feedback path (K2); *MIST* feeds the delay buffer into a series of allpass filters for a reverb effect, while *DUB* saturates the signal. Echo time (K3) is synced to BPM. Feedback (E2) controls how much of the output is fed back into the delay input. Mix (E3) is really a control for the wet signal only; the dry signal always fully passes.


#### Controls
| Control | Function | Description |
|:--------|:---------|:------------|
| K2 | Echo style (mist/dub) | Selects the echo style |
| K3 | Echo time | Always synced to clock: 1/64, 1/32, 1/32D, 1/16, 5/64, 1/16D, 1/8, 5/32, 1/8D |
| E2 | Feedback (0-1) | Controls the amount of echo feedback |
| E3 | Mix (0-1) | Sets the wet/dry mix of the echo effect |
