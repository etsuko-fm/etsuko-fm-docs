# Echo

A delay effect with a selectable feedback path (K2); *MIST* feeds the delay buffer into a series of allpass filters for a reverb effect, while *DUB* saturates the signal. Echo time (K3) is synced to BPM. Feedback (E2) controls how much of the output is fed back into the delay input. Mix (E3) is really a control for the wet signal only; the dry signal always fully passes.
