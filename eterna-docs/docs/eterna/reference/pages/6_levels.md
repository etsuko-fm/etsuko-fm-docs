# Levels

Controls the levels of all voices via a Gaussian distribution (Bell curve). An LFO is available to automate movement; this affects the position parameter. 

There's also a metering visualization: when playback is active, the current amplitude of each voice is shown realtime inside the bar graphs.

#### Controls
- K2: Toggle LFO on/off
- K3: Select LFO waveform   
- E2: Position of the center of the bell curve; or LFO rate, when the LFO rate is enabled.
- E3: Amp - controls the sigma of the bell curve. When set to 0, this can be used together with Position to solo a voice.
