# Slice

Cut the sample into 1-32 slices with E3. There are 6 voices; each of them is assigned 1 slice for playback. If the number of slices is smaller than 6, one or more slices are used with multiple voices.

When a mono sample is selected, the selected start slice (E2) is assigned to voice 1, while each next slice is assigned to the next voice. See the screenshot below: slice 2 to 7 are assigned to voice 1 to 6.

When a stereo sample is selected, each next slice is taken from the alternating channel:

- slice 1 → channel 1
- slice 2 → channel 2
- slice 3 → channel 1
- slice 4 → channel 2
- slice 5 → channel 1
- slice 6 → channel 2

The graphic doesn't explicitly indicate which slice is assigned to which channel, but when the sequence triggers a voice, the slice flashes according to its envelope, which helps to identify which slice is being played back.

When a multichannel sample is selected (up to 6 channels), each next slice is taken from the next channel, wrapping around back to channel 1 when each channel has provided a slice. 

For an example with a 4-channel file:

- slice 1 → channel 1
- slice 2 → channel 2
- slice 3 → channel 3
- slice 4 → channel 4
- slice 5 → channel 1
- slice 6 → channel 2
